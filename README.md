# DESCRIPTION : AI-CHATBOT-WITH-NLP

To build a chatbot capable of answering user queries using Natural Language Processing (NLP), we can use libraries like NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) or spaCy. I will guide you through the process of creating a simple text-based chatbot that answers user queries.

# Step 1: Install Required Libraries
Before starting, you'll need to install NLTK (or spaCy if you choose), as well as some additional dependencies:
NLTK is a comprehensive library for working with text data and performing NLP tasks. It includes tools for tokenization, classification, stemming, and more. We’ll be using NLTK in this example.

# Step 2: Create the Chatbot
1. Import Necessary Libraries:
We’ll need some basic libraries from NLTK for text processing
2. Define Patterns and Responses:
Next, we define a list of patterns that our chatbot will recognize and provide responses to. This is done through simple regular expressions that match user input.
3.Create the Chatbot Class:
Use NLTK’s Chat class to process the patterns and match them with user input.

# Step 4: Running the Script
To run the chatbot:
1.Save the above code in a file, for example chatbot.py.
2.In your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where chatbot.py is saved.
3.Run the script with: python chatbot.py

# Step 5: Chatting with the Bot
Once the script is running, you’ll see the following output:

Hello, I am Chatbot. Type 'bye' to end the conversation.
> hi
Hello! How can I assist you today?

> how are you?
I am doing great, thank you for asking! How about you?

> what is your name?
I am a chatbot created by Codtech. You can call me Codbot!

> help
Sure, how can I help you?

> goodbye
Goodbye! Have a great day!

# Step 6: Expanding the Chatbot
Adding more patterns to handle more complex queries.
Integrating machine learning models for more advanced interactions (e.g., using spaCy or transformers for semantic understanding).
Using APIs to provide real-time information, like weather or news updates.
Deliverables:
Python Script: chatbot.py
Working Chatbot: The chatbot will interact with the user, responding based on predefined patterns.
